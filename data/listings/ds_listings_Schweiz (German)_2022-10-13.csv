As a senior data scientist you are capable of rapidly learning about the domain of our customers, build models and prototypes and coach data scientists in their way of working.

How will you help

in creating value with Data & AI

At GoDataDriven, we build strong data & AI practices to deliver value to our clients and their customers. In the past, our team of data professionals has predicted the daily demand for millions of loaves of bread, built advanced energy-saving algorithms to nationwide scale, and set up data innovation labs at large multinational corporations.

What you will do

to make data intensive-applications work effectively and securely.

You start by assessing the value-driven use cases at the client and a good sense of what success looks like. Then you apply your skills in mathematics, statistics, machine learning and programming to analyze and model data. You work mostly with notebooks in Python and are also able to translate your notebooks into a working prototype. Together with a machine learning engineer or data engineer, you help to get the model into production and assess the value it creates. If required, you also set up a good way of working for your team, with a proper dev-ops for AI approach.

When you're working on-site with a client, you eventually come across something really difficult to solve. Luckily, every few weeks everyone from GDD comes to our office to work remotely on their projects and you have the opportunity to discuss and even solve your problems with the help of the hive mind of GDD. And if that would take too long, everybody at GDD is just a quick message away and ready to help you at any time.

Who Are We Looking For?

THIS IS YOUR DREAM JOB IF…

if you like working with new data processing tools, like Airflow, Spark, Flink, and Druid.

if you understand the importance of cloud and know your way around or want to learn that.

if you like working for different clients and enjoy the excitement of regularly getting to learn new environments and know new people.

You speak German at a minimum B2 level

THIS IS NOT YOUR DREAM JOB IF…

if you do not like working under pressure to get things done in the best way possible with limited time you have to finish it.

if you do not like working with open source technology.

if you do not like coding, scripting, templating.
