The Bureau's Research Program sits within the Science and Innovation Group and is the main driver of world-class science-based innovation in the Bureau of Meteorology aligned with the Group’s R&D Plan 2020-2030. In supporting the Bureau to deliver impactful weather, water, climate, oceans and earth system prediction services, the research contributes to advancing meteorological and earth system sciences in Australia and globally. Research activities cover the broad fields of weather, climate, oceanography, land surface, and earth systems modelling, data set development, process studies, and application development.

The Hydrological Modelling team of the Bureau’s Research Program is seeking to fill the role of Scientist – Earth System Scientist. The successful candidate will lead novel research into hydrological and land surface dynamics modelling within the Hydrological Modelling team. A particular focus of this role is on the future operational land surface model’s re-parameterisation and verification (vegetation and soil physics) and in particular leading the Hydrological Modelling team’s work on the assimilation of new or novel observations into the land surface scheme. The successful candidate is also expected to contribute to discussions and take in part responsibility of the definition and progression of the Hydrological Modelling team’s main aims, using their understanding of customer needs.

The Earth System Scientist role is to lead relevant work packages within the Hydrological Modelling research program, and collaborate on select projects scientific and technical staff across the Research Program and other Bureau employees, as well as external stakeholders, in particular from the UK MetOffice and UK Centre for Environment and Hydrology. This requires the successful candidate to have experience in liaising effectively with such partners.
Tasks include developing research plans and overseeing their delivery within the designated work packages, including hands-on work on Earth observation data assessments, parameterisation of the land surface schemes within continental-scale hydrological/land surface models, and undertaking data assimilation experiments together with colleagues across the Research program, using scripting and coding languages (e.g. Python) on the Bureau’s and NCI’s Linux systems.

Where relevant, the Earth System Scientist will also contribute or lead strategic initiatives of broader value to the entire Bureau (e.g. the National Satellite Program on Earth Observations).",A$70K - A$110K (Employer est.),,1001 to 5000 Employees,Government & Public Administration,Unknown / Non-Applicable,,3.6,73 %,N/A,,3.2,3.4,3.5,2.7,4.3,,,4120,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Australian-Bureau-of-Meteorology-Reviews-E695311.htm,
