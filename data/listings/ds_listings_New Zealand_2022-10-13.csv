Project Description
The goal is to develop a predictive machine learning models for (upcoming) social unrest at the local/regional/subnational level the United States, beginning with New York city, and other region. There are several existing risk indices at either a country level or at a city level (e.g. Lloyd’s City Index https://cityriskindex.lloyds.com/). Most of these are based on economic factors, although recently political instability and other factors are being considered. However, they rarely use online language data, which Peloria has found to be highly associated with enhanced model predictive accuracy in its work elsewhere (see Peloria’s website for some examples). Such indices are used by government and businesses to decide where to locate or mainstream new and existing operations as well as governments to better identify the location, scale, nature and timing of development activities. Insurance companies have developed their own risk indices based on claims paid out and other macro-economic data. For the most part, however, such indices reflect subjective interpretation, particularly in regard to issues surrounding governance, globalization, and social group specific exclusion.",$84K - $145K (Glassdoor Est.),"$70,000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,93,,
