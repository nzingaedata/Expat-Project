Each intern works on a focussed project supported by one of the senior data scientists in the Digital Analytics and Research Team (DART) in areas such as: natural language processing, synthetic data, graph representations, privacy enhancing technologies, machine learning, explainability and simulation. The outputs from the work are shared openly where appropriate. Currently open and previous projects can be viewedhere

Further details of the internship scheme can be foundhere
Please be aware that we require some additional information for these internships to support sifting and prioritisations. This information needs to be included in the “Supporting Information” section of the application.

This information required includes:
Title of your current PhD placement or course
Whilst the advert specifies a January start date we are recruiting for both the January and June wave at the same time.

The successful candidate will occupy a permanent role within the NHS Transformation Directorate Digital Analytics and Research Team (DART) for the duration of their internship. During the internship the candidate will be expected to progress their chosen project autonomously with supervision from colleagues in DART as well as their current academic supervisor. The candidate will be expected to be focussed on the project and self-driven during the internship period, providing regular updates on progress and issues.

Within the topic area of the chosen project, there will be some freedom to direct the development of the research and knowledge but this will also need to be balanced against creating a learning outcome or tangible output, that benefits the PhD scheme objectives and is in a shareable state for future projects to pick up and continue the development.

As the candidate will be an NHS England employee during the internship period, standard employment checks and some mandatory training are required.


The Digital Analytics and Research Team (DART) sits within the Transformation Directorate. The team aims to modernise and strengthen the use of data and analytics across the NHS and Social Care system and support digital transformation.

The team consists of analysts, economists, evaluation specialists, data scientists and data engineers that sit across three workstreams: analytics as a profession, programme analytics and innovative analytics.

Examples of the work done within this team can be foundhere

This internship scheme aims to connect NHS real data and issues with academic thought and research through short-term PhD internships. The benefit to the NHS is the added value that academia brings to evidence-based research but on timescales that allow the insights to be acted upon. For the student and university, the benefit is an avenue to conduct related research in an industrial environment and access to NHS data.

We are looking for PhD students working in a quantitative discipline but with an interest in applying their knowledge and gaining experience of creating solutions for the NHS. Both student and university will be funded during the duration of the internship covering between three and six months.

Our aim is to continually build on previous learning whilst having an avenue for including the latest research and approaches.
