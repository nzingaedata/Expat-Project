The Child and Adolescent Health Group, headed by Prof. Dr. med. Claudia Kuehni, conducts population-based and clinical studies in child health.
Do you like to be a key driver of a revolution in big data in the field of paediatric research? Improve the lives of children for generations to come in Switzerland? In this position, you will be part of the Swiss-wide National Data Stream “SwissPedHealth” platform, which includes 7 paediatric hospitals in Switzerland and is funded by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN). You will make routine data from clinical encounters in children's hospitals available to the paediatric research community. The data stream will combine health data from all university children's hospitals, cantonal hospitals, health registries, and research institutions to build a dataset of >1 million children. You will also collaborate internationally and compare your data with similar initiatives from other countries, such as a large dataset from the US with information from >12 million children.

The combined dataset will be analysed in several nested research projects. You will mainly be involved in one that does focus on childhood cancer patients. Since 1976 children diagnosed with cancer are reported actively to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (www.childhoodcancerregistry.ch) to record cancer incidence, treatment, and survival. Until now, data entry and quality control are manual. This leads to delays in registration and duplication of work.

Job Description
About us

TotalEnergies has developed a strong expertise in oil and biofuels, natural gas and electricity trading. Trading entities are based in Geneva, Paris, Houston and Singapore.

TotalEnergies installed its European trading hub in Geneva, which now bring together very large teams around trading activities: TotalEnergies Trading & Shipping (T&S) and TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP).

TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) is the trading arm of TotalEnergies in the field of low carbon energies (mainly gas, LNG and power). As such, it operates in fast-evolving market dynamics influenced by internal and external factors that require constant adaptation and evolution.

Uncertainties specific to the trading environment (volatility of prices, supply & demand mismatches) are coupled with those coming from the broader energy sector (climate change policies, changes in the energy mix, developments of new energy sources, etc). In such context, TGP helps to ensure growth and profitability to a key segment of the business in order to reach the objective of Carbon Neutrality by 2050.

We are offering a unique opportunity for an experienced analyst with sound knowledge of the Power markets to join our Quantitative & Trading Analysis team based in Geneva, part of TGP. You will mainly be working on Power to support the growth of this business and by such you will be exposed to some high stake problematics.



You will be part of the Quantitative & Trading Analysis team (Q&TA) and will report to the Head of Quantitative & Trading Analysis.
You will perform your job on the trading floor, with regular contacts with Houston and Singapore based teams and with Paris headquarter.

The Quantitative and Trading Analysis (Q&TA) team aims at providing a better understanding of the gas, LNG, power and emissions markets traded by TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) in terms of prices and fundamentals, finding ways to model and forecast their dynamics and dealing with complex issues requiring a quantitative approach (pricing, hedging and simulations of complex products, transactions or assets).
In a context of great autonomy, the Q&TA team contributes interpretation, advisory and support to all TGP trading desks and to senior management - including COMEX members - and helps them define trading strategies and take investment decisions.
You will work with trading desks and other stakeholders throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging data in order to help traders take positions on the market and more broadly the company to catch new business opportunities. This requires in-depth analysis of complex and unique problems as well as creative and strategic thinking.
You will cover primarily the European power and emissions markets but will get exposure to and support projects related to all the commodities traded by TGP.





We are committed to meet the energy needs of a growing population and we are committed to the energy transition. The volatility of the energy trading markets requires excellence in risk management and a culture of innovation. We are fully embracing the digital revolution.
Our people flourish in an environment that promotes expertise, entrepreneurship spirit, agility and a purpose-driven culture, generating boundless opportunities to learn, grow and achieve collaborative success.

Job Description
About us

TotalEnergies has developed a strong expertise in oil and biofuels, natural gas and electricity trading. Trading entities are based in Geneva, Paris, Houston and Singapore.

TotalEnergies installed its European trading hub in Geneva, which now bring together very large teams around trading activities: TotalEnergies Trading & Shipping (T&S) and TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP).

TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) is the trading arm of TotalEnergies in the field of low carbon energies (mainly gas, LNG and power). As such, it operates in fast-evolving market dynamics influenced by internal and external factors that require constant adaptation and evolution.

Uncertainties specific to the trading environment (volatility of prices, supply & demand mismatches) are coupled with those coming from the broader energy sector (climate change policies, changes in the energy mix, developments of new energy sources, etc). In such context, TGP helps to ensure growth and profitability to a key segment of the business in order to reach the objective of Carbon Neutrality by 2050.

We are offering a unique opportunity for an experienced analyst with sound knowledge of the Power markets to join our Quantitative & Trading Analysis team based in Geneva, part of TGP. You will mainly be working on Power to support the growth of this business and by such you will be exposed to some high stake problematics.



You will be part of the Quantitative & Trading Analysis team (Q&TA) and will report to the Head of Quantitative & Trading Analysis.
You will perform your job on the trading floor, with regular contacts with Houston and Singapore based teams and with Paris headquarter.

The Quantitative and Trading Analysis (Q&TA) team aims at providing a better understanding of the gas, LNG, power and emissions markets traded by TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) in terms of prices and fundamentals, finding ways to model and forecast their dynamics and dealing with complex issues requiring a quantitative approach (pricing, hedging and simulations of complex products, transactions or assets).
In a context of great autonomy, the Q&TA team contributes interpretation, advisory and support to all TGP trading desks and to senior management - including COMEX members - and helps them define trading strategies and take investment decisions.
You will work with trading desks and other stakeholders throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging data in order to help traders take positions on the market and more broadly the company to catch new business opportunities. This requires in-depth analysis of complex and unique problems as well as creative and strategic thinking.
You will cover primarily the European power and emissions markets but will get exposure to and support projects related to all the commodities traded by TGP.





We are committed to meet the energy needs of a growing population and we are committed to the energy transition. The volatility of the energy trading markets requires excellence in risk management and a culture of innovation. We are fully embracing the digital revolution.
Our people flourish in an environment that promotes expertise, entrepreneurship spirit, agility and a purpose-driven culture, generating boundless opportunities to learn, grow and achieve collaborative success.

Technology-driven combinatorial therapy to rewire the spinal cord after injury (ReWIRE) is set up to equip next-generation scientists with unique skills to develop ground-breaking therapeutic solutions for patients with paralysis. The specific transdisciplinary and translational aspects will fill a gap in the traditional education programs and foster R&D competence in the field of medical products and therapies focused on spinal cord injury (SCI). The first objective is to establish an international, interdisciplinary, and intersectoral educational network that develops and links high-tech routes into new personalized, combinatorial approaches to rewire the spinal cord. The second objective is to build a clinical data platform for SCI. The third objective is to position Europe at the forefront of therapy for SCI. ReWIRE follows an international, interdisciplinary, and intersectoral approach organized in 8 and 7 interwoven work and training packages, respectively.
The training and research parts are focused on developing the next generation specialists and technologies in the European Research Area (ERA) to conform to the rapidly evolving technologies for individualized therapies to treat SCI. Specifically, ReWIRE aims to establish meaningful long-term and autonomous functional recovery by combining axonal regrowth and reconnection with new neuronal circuits, controlled by the brain and boosted by neuromodulation. The overall goal is to translate combinatorial SCI therapies from bench to bedside in a timely manner, thereby improving the quality of life and reducing societal burden. To regenerate the spinal cord, axons must be reactivated and stimulated, chemo-attracted, supported, and guided across the lesion site and into the spared tissue. Plasticity of spared connections must be generated in combination with functional new connections via the formation of terminal-like contacts, exhibiting synaptic markers and re-establishing electrophysiological conduction capacity across the lesion. The convergent approach will lead to combinatorial therapies to repair the spinal cord after injury, which, to date, has not been successful using individual therapies.",,,De 1 à 50 employés,,,,3.2,N/A,N/A,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,400,,

Technology-driven combinatorial therapy to rewire the spinal cord after injury (ReWIRE) is set up to equip next-generation scientists with unique skills to develop ground-breaking therapeutic solutions for patients with paralysis. The specific transdisciplinary and translational aspects will fill a gap in the traditional education programs and foster R&D competence in the field of medical products and therapies focused on spinal cord injury (SCI). The first objective is to establish an international, interdisciplinary, and intersectoral educational network that develops and links high-tech routes into new personalized, combinatorial approaches to rewire the spinal cord. The second objective is to build a clinical data platform for SCI. The third objective is to position Europe at the forefront of therapy for SCI. ReWIRE follows an international, interdisciplinary, and intersectoral approach organized in 8 and 7 interwoven work and training packages, respectively.
The training and research parts are focused on developing the next generation specialists and technologies in the European Research Area (ERA) to conform to the rapidly evolving technologies for individualized therapies to treat SCI. Specifically, ReWIRE aims to establish meaningful long-term and autonomous functional recovery by combining axonal regrowth and reconnection with new neuronal circuits, controlled by the brain and boosted by neuromodulation. The overall goal is to translate combinatorial SCI therapies from bench to bedside in a timely manner, thereby improving the quality of life and reducing societal burden. To regenerate the spinal cord, axons must be reactivated and stimulated, chemo-attracted, supported, and guided across the lesion site and into the spared tissue. Plasticity of spared connections must be generated in combination with functional new connections via the formation of terminal-like contacts, exhibiting synaptic markers and re-establishing electrophysiological conduction capacity across the lesion. The convergent approach will lead to combinatorial therapies to repair the spinal cord after injury, which, to date, has not been successful using individual therapies.",,,De 1 à 50 employés,,,,3.2,N/A,N/A,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,400,,

The Child and Adolescent Health Group, headed by Prof. Dr. med. Claudia Kuehni, conducts population-based and clinical studies in child health.
Do you like to be a key driver of a revolution in big data in the field of paediatric research? Improve the lives of children for generations to come in Switzerland? In this position, you will be part of the Swiss-wide National Data Stream “SwissPedHealth” platform, which includes 7 paediatric hospitals in Switzerland and is funded by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN). You will make routine data from clinical encounters in children's hospitals available to the paediatric research community. The data stream will combine health data from all university children's hospitals, cantonal hospitals, health registries, and research institutions to build a dataset of >1 million children. You will also collaborate internationally and compare your data with similar initiatives from other countries, such as a large dataset from the US with information from >12 million children.

The combined dataset will be analysed in several nested research projects. You will mainly be involved in one that does focus on childhood cancer patients. Since 1976 children diagnosed with cancer are reported actively to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (www.childhoodcancerregistry.ch) to record cancer incidence, treatment, and survival. Until now, data entry and quality control are manual. This leads to delays in registration and duplication of work.

Job Description
About us

TotalEnergies has developed a strong expertise in oil and biofuels, natural gas and electricity trading. Trading entities are based in Geneva, Paris, Houston and Singapore.

TotalEnergies installed its European trading hub in Geneva, which now bring together very large teams around trading activities: TotalEnergies Trading & Shipping (T&S) and TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP).

TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) is the trading arm of TotalEnergies in the field of low carbon energies (mainly gas, LNG and power). As such, it operates in fast-evolving market dynamics influenced by internal and external factors that require constant adaptation and evolution.

Uncertainties specific to the trading environment (volatility of prices, supply & demand mismatches) are coupled with those coming from the broader energy sector (climate change policies, changes in the energy mix, developments of new energy sources, etc). In such context, TGP helps to ensure growth and profitability to a key segment of the business in order to reach the objective of Carbon Neutrality by 2050.

We are offering a unique opportunity for an experienced analyst with sound knowledge of the Power markets to join our Quantitative & Trading Analysis team based in Geneva, part of TGP. You will mainly be working on Power to support the growth of this business and by such you will be exposed to some high stake problematics.



You will be part of the Quantitative & Trading Analysis team (Q&TA) and will report to the Head of Quantitative & Trading Analysis.
You will perform your job on the trading floor, with regular contacts with Houston and Singapore based teams and with Paris headquarter.

The Quantitative and Trading Analysis (Q&TA) team aims at providing a better understanding of the gas, LNG, power and emissions markets traded by TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) in terms of prices and fundamentals, finding ways to model and forecast their dynamics and dealing with complex issues requiring a quantitative approach (pricing, hedging and simulations of complex products, transactions or assets).
In a context of great autonomy, the Q&TA team contributes interpretation, advisory and support to all TGP trading desks and to senior management - including COMEX members - and helps them define trading strategies and take investment decisions.
You will work with trading desks and other stakeholders throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging data in order to help traders take positions on the market and more broadly the company to catch new business opportunities. This requires in-depth analysis of complex and unique problems as well as creative and strategic thinking.
You will cover primarily the European power and emissions markets but will get exposure to and support projects related to all the commodities traded by TGP.





We are committed to meet the energy needs of a growing population and we are committed to the energy transition. The volatility of the energy trading markets requires excellence in risk management and a culture of innovation. We are fully embracing the digital revolution.
Our people flourish in an environment that promotes expertise, entrepreneurship spirit, agility and a purpose-driven culture, generating boundless opportunities to learn, grow and achieve collaborative success.
Reinforcing the competencies of our people is a key pillar of our culture: we train our people to ensure their development and we pledge to encourage safety in all our actions.
We look for passion, ambition and open-mindedness. While we evolve in a demanding industry that requests to be always on the edge, we cultivate a friendly workplace where our people feel good, where team spirit and respect guide our daily routine, where the diversity of our people and their skills create a nourishing experience for all of us.",,,Plus de 10''000 employés,Énergie et infrastructures,Énergie et exploitation des ressources naturelles,Entre 25 et 100 millions de dollars US,3.9,77 %,85 %,4.5,3.4,3.6,3.6,3.2,3.7,,,400,https://fr.glassdoor.ch/Avis/TotalEnergies-Avis-E1038.htm,https://fr.glassdoor.ch/Benefits/TotalEnergies-Benefits-E1038.htm

TotalEnergies has developed a strong expertise in oil and biofuels, natural gas and electricity trading. Trading entities are based in Geneva, Paris, Houston and Singapore.

TotalEnergies installed its European trading hub in Geneva, which now bring together very large teams around trading activities: TotalEnergies Trading & Shipping (T&S) and TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP).

TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) is the trading arm of TotalEnergies in the field of low carbon energies (mainly gas, LNG and power). As such, it operates in fast-evolving market dynamics influenced by internal and external factors that require constant adaptation and evolution.

Uncertainties specific to the trading environment (volatility of prices, supply & demand mismatches) are coupled with those coming from the broader energy sector (climate change policies, changes in the energy mix, developments of new energy sources, etc). In such context, TGP helps to ensure growth and profitability to a key segment of the business in order to reach the objective of Carbon Neutrality by 2050.

We are offering a unique opportunity for an experienced analyst with sound knowledge of the Power markets to join our Quantitative & Trading Analysis team based in Geneva, part of TGP. You will mainly be working on Power to support the growth of this business and by such you will be exposed to some high stake problematics.

You will perform your job on the trading floor, with regular contacts with Houston and Singapore based teams and with Paris headquarter.

The Quantitative and Trading Analysis (Q&TA) team aims at providing a better understanding of the gas, LNG, power and emissions markets traded by TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) in terms of prices and fundamentals, finding ways to model and forecast their dynamics and dealing with complex issues requiring a quantitative approach (pricing, hedging and simulations of complex products, transactions or assets).
In a context of great autonomy, the Q&TA team contributes interpretation, advisory and support to all TGP trading desks and to senior management - including COMEX members - and helps them define trading strategies and take investment decisions.
You will work with trading desks and other stakeholders throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging data in order to help traders take positions on the market and more broadly the company to catch new business opportunities. This requires in-depth analysis of complex and unique problems as well as creative and strategic thinking.
You will cover primarily the European power and emissions markets but will get exposure to and support projects related to all the commodities traded by TGP.





We are committed to meet the energy needs of a growing population and we are committed to the energy transition. The volatility of the energy trading markets requires excellence in risk management and a culture of innovation. We are fully embracing the digital revolution.
Our people flourish in an environment that promotes expertise, entrepreneurship spirit, agility and a purpose-driven culture, generating boundless opportunities to learn, grow and achieve collaborative success.
Reinforcing the competencies of our people is a key pillar of our culture: we train our people to ensure their development and we pledge to encourage safety in all our actions.
