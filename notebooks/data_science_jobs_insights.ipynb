    "\n",
    "In this project I scraped job postings related to Data Science field from www.glassdoor.com. This project is inspired by Ken Jee (https://github.com/PlayingNumbers). I have used a modified version of Ken Jee's selenium code because that code was not working raw for me. Selenium was used because it has small chance of getting caught by glassdoor as it mimics a human kind of interaction. Sending too many request could still increase chances of getting IP block, this limited the dataset to only 1000 jobs."

    "\n",
    "I am a US based Data Scientist looking to make a major lifestyle change which includes living abroad and looking for remote or hybrid opportunities. In order to best prepare for the next opportunity, I thought it would be best to review popular job search engines to see which companies were best reviewed by their employees and offered the best work-life balance, benefits and salaries across different countries. I am applying for entry/junior level positions and want to know whick skills I would need to freshen up or develop before I apply for the job. "
